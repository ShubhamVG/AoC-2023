Today's roll was actually GPT/prompting but either my prompting skills are bad (unlikely because I used it a lot in my last internship) or that Bard & ChatGPT are awful when it comes to writing code and solving programming puzzles. I gave up prompting and as a punishment, chose to solve this day's puzzle in C.

And damn, part 2 is really badly written. It takes around 10 minutes to give the answer lol. I would have written really optimized code had I not gotten this awful p-lang smh.

~~Or maybe I am trying to cover up my awful awful coding skillsðŸ’€~~

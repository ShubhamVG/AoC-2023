Finally a problem that I wasn't able to solve on my own. Both parts were easy, just that part 2 was very unclear. The thought of using LCM to solve part 2 did cross my mind but I was unsure whether that work for every case. After doodling a lil bit and trying some maths, I ended up watching a solution video from _HyperNeutrino_ on YouTube and even he just made the assumption that LCM might work and it did so he went with it. Judging from the criticisms on Discord, a lot of folks seems to have done the same.

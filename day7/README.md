Today's roll was Go which surprisingly, I haven't used in a while, and before you say this, I know that I might have over-engineered today's solution :p

It was very much intentional because I wanted to _dust off the rust on my Go skills..._, yeah I have no idea what I just said lol.

And oh, I had to not home for a few days so a lot of days were missed. I solved the first half like 3 days ago and on a different machines (unsynced sadge) so I didn't get the time to organize them. Sorry!

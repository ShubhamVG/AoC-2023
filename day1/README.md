Today's randomly chosen programming language was... C (my day couldn't have been more awful)

I know I poorly wrote part 2 but on the hindsight, I WAS SUFFERING BY WRITING C CODE. I GOT SO MANY NEW ERRORS THAT I DIDN'T KNOW EXISTED. SO MANY MEMORY LEAKS AND WTF IS EVEN STACK SMASHING?! SO FORK YOU! But yeah I agree, there were better ways to do solve part 2.

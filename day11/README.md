I wasn't able to complete day 10's part 2 so uploading day 11 first.

About day 10: I haven't worked with border detections before (except with images like Sobel's operator) and I don't want to just watch the solution so I might take a few more days.

I was lucky to get today's roll as Dart again but I am thinking to only use Dart from now on. Let's see though, I may or may not follow whatever I just said ¯\\\_(ツ)\_/¯

I will take a few days off again. I hope the streak does not just stops when I get back :p
